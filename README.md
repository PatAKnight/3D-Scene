# 3D-Scene

In my CS 330 course I was tasked with working on a 3D scene. This project showcases my ability to incorporate third party libraries into my work. The 3D scene is written in C++ utilizing the OpenGL library. OpenGL is a library that can be used to render 2D and 3D graphics. OpenGL accesses the graphics card of the computer that I was working on to render the scene. 

The 3D scene has several simple shapes that are combined to create complex shapes. The simple shapes that are incorporated into the scene are planes, cylinders, rectangles, and tori. The complex shapes within the scene are a cup, pen, Gameboy, Gameboy cartrige, and binder. Using matrices that containted the coordinates of the shapes, I placed these complex shapes around the scene. Matrices multiplaction also was used to manipulate the shapes in the form of rotation and translation. Within the scene is a light source that allows for a more dynamic scene. Using vector math, the shapes are lit correctly by the light source. Finally, the scene has camera controls that allow the user to move around the scene. The camera controls use the WASD keys to travese the scene.



# Questions from the course
1.	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

When designing software, I normally take a step-by-step approach with iterations. I will break down everything into steps that I can slowly add to my project. Breaking down a project into steps makes it easier to debug issues. One design skill that this project has helped me with is the ability to break up large files into smaller more manageable files. Every iteration that was done to this project added several new aspects to the main file. I would then go through the main file and look for parts of the code that would be better suited in their own file.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I did not really use any new approaches to designing this project. I mainly followed my same method of implementing features in iterations. I find that with iterations, I can test to ensure functionality with ease. Whenever I add a new function or feature to the project, I can test to ensure that the new portion of code work properly. 

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

A degree in Computer Science can help me reach my goal of becoming a Software Engineer. Each new module has helped to add new skills for me to use in my path. This class helped hone my skill of reading documentation to understand what the different functions that were used in creating a scene in OpenGL. There are many different functions that were used to bind vertex arrays and draw triangles. To better understand what the different functions did within the project I made sure to read the documentation.
