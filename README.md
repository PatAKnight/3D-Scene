1.	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

When designing software, I normally take a step-by-step approach with iterations. I will break down everything into steps that I can slowly add to my project. Breaking down a project into steps makes it easier to debug issues. One design skill that this project has helped me with is the ability to break up large files into smaller more manageable files. Every iteration that was done to this project added several new aspects to the main file. I would then go through the main file and look for parts of the code that would be better suited in their own file.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I did not really use any new approaches to designing this project. I mainly followed my same method of implementing features in iterations. I find that with iterations, I can test to ensure functionality with ease. Whenever I add a new function or feature to the project, I can test to ensure that the new portion of code work properly. 

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

A degree in Computer Science can help me reach my goal of becoming a Software Engineer. Each new module has helped to add new skills for me to use in my path. This class helped hone my skill of reading documentation to understand what the different functions that were used in creating a scene in OpenGL. There are many different functions that were used to bind vertex arrays and draw triangles. To better understand what the different functions did within the project I made sure to read the documentation.
